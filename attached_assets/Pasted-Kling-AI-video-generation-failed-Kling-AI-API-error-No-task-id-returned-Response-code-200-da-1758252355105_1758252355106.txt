In Scene 1, the camera will begin with a wide shot, slowly zooming in on the three-ring chandelier, showcasing its elegant design and the warm light emitted. In Scene 2, the camera will smoothly pan from the orange armchair to the abstract coffee table, revealing the green glass chandelier's intricacies. After showcasing both chandeliers, the camera will end with a final close-up of the three-ring LED chandelier from Scene 1, subtly rotating it for a complete view.\n\nCamera and Production: Create a 5-second video showcasing two distinct interior design styles in a split-screen format. The left side displays a minimalist dining room with a light beige/gold interlocking ring chandelier (the light gently pulses) above a sleek, light brown rectangular dining table. The room has light beige walls, light wood flooring, and sheer beige curtains. A simple vase of white tulips sits as a centerpiece. The right side depicts a more luxurious and opulent living room with a large, circular, mirrored ceiling feature adorned with a dramatic, organically shaped, green glass sculpture-like light fixture (the light subtly shifts and twinkles). The room has dark wood paneling, a textured, abstract rug, and a sculptural, dark bronze coffee table. A burnt orange velvet armchair sits next to the coffee table. The camera smoothly pans across both scenes simultaneously, highlighting the key design features and creating a seamless transition. Render the scene in a photorealistic CGI style with high-quality textures and lighting, focusing on the visual appeal and contrast between the two spaces. Focus primarily on the larger elements: the chandelier and the large sculpture. The video should emphasize the product design of the two lighting fixtures."},"output":{"type":"","status":0,"works":null},"meta":{"created_at":"2025-09-19T03:24:55.678503818Z","started_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","ended_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","usage":{"type":"point","frozen":2600000,"consume":0},"is_using_private_pool":false},"detail":null,"logs":null,"error":{"code":0,"raw_message":"","message":"","detail":null}},"message":"success"}
